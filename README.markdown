## Overview

`growl-pianobar` is a shell script that displays a [growl][1] notification when the current song on [pianobar][2] changes.

## Usage

`growl-pianobar` should never be invoked directly. But should instead be referenced in pianobar's configuration file.

## Installation

Simply run the installation script with this command:

	./install.sh

Now when you run pianobar and the song changes, you should be notified via growl of the current song.

## Compatibility

`growl-pianobar` is compatible with Mac OS X. You need to have [growlnotify][3] installed.
